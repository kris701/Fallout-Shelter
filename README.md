# Fallout Shelter
This was a small map design project that i made for the game Garrys Mod. I wanted to make a map, but only a small one where i could focus a lot on details. So i made this little map, where the idea is that you are trapped in a fallout shelter, where you can sometimes hear the low rumbles of explosions outside. You are stuck however, just counting your days until you run out of food.
